      <description>Istio is becoming one of the standards in the service mesh scenario. It is being developed and pushed by some of the giants of the industry like IBM, Google or RedHat and now version 1.0 is going to celebrate its first anniversary.
All major cloud providers are including a service mesh in their managed services, like AWS with it&amp;rsquo;s App Service Mesh, IBM with the managed Istio add-on or Google Cloud with Istio on GKE.</description>

      <description>In the last week I passed both exams of the CNCF for Kubernetes, first the CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) and finally the CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Kubernetes and OpenShift for the last 4 years, and I wanted to challenge my knowledge through the certifications.
The CKAD exam First I went for the CKAD, even I&amp;rsquo;m working in the last years very close to system administrators I still fill closer to the Development.</description>
